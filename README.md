<h1>Interactive Boardgame of Animal Sounds in Different Languages</h1>

This repository highlights the prototyping of a simple boardgame idea: discovering animal sounds in different languages. My girlfriend and I have been brainstorming a boardgame around this premise for a number of years, so I decided to first develop a web-based demo as a proof-of-concept.

The following links were inspirations for this idea...

</ul>

In brainstorming a physical boardgame (still in the works), I found it difficult to explain the concept to people so I decided to make a simplified web-based demo to highlight the concepts. This demo consists of four parts...

<ol>
<li>Generate a boardgame grid >>> <code>boardgame-GenerateGrid.html</code></li>
<li>Drag-and-drop objects (game pieces) onto the grid >>> <code>boardgame-SimpleShapes.html</code></li>
<li>Use animal shapes for game pieces >>> <code>boardgame-SimpleAnimals.html</code></li>
<li>Add country flags and animal sounds >>> <code>boardgame-AnimalSoundsFlags.html</code></li>
</ol>

<h1>1. Generate a Boardgame Grid</h1>

The first step was to make an SVG-based boardgame grid generator.
